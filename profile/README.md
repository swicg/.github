## W3C SocialCG

The Social Web Incubator Community Group (also known as SocialCG, or SWICG) is the successor of the Social Web Working Group, which ran from 2014 to 2017.

The SocialCG provides space to collaborate and coordinate for implementers who are building on any of the specifications published by the Social Web WG, and related technologies. It is also a place to incubate new proposals which build on or complement the Social Web WG recommendations.

Anyone who is interested in learning about and/or contributing to advancing the social web is welcome to join the group.
